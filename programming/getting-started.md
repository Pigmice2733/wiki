# Learn Python on Windows

1. Download and install the latest version of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download and install the latest version of Atom [here](https://atom.io/)
3. Download and install the latest version of Github [here](https://desktop.github.com/)
4. To clone FRC team 1418's "PyBasicTraining" from Github, first go [here](https://github.com/frc1418/pybasictraining). 
From there, click the green "Clone or download" button. Then, click the small clipboard icon.This will copy the URL of the whole 
project and allow you access to the code.
5. Powershell can be accessed by pressing the Windows key, and typing Powershell into the search bar. Depending on the version of
Windows, "Powershell" or "Windows Powershell" will appear.
6. Once done finishing the code, save it to somewhere you can easily access or know the location of (such as your desktop or
a file you know the name of). In Powershell, type "cd" and then the name or address of where the saved file is stored. This will open
it in Powershell and allow you access to run it or change certain parts of it.
7. Once inside the file in Powershell, type `./run_all.bat`, or, in other projects the function used to run the code. This will
simply run everything inside the file.
