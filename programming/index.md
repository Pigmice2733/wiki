# Programming

The Programming team sets up the robot to move based on the driver's controls.

## Python
We program the robot using [Python](https://www.python.org/). Here are a few guides to general python use.

- [Getting Started with Python](getting-started)
- [Learn Python](https://www.learnpython.org/)
- [Codecademy Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python)
- [Python Primer](https://robotpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/python.html#python-primer)

## RobotPy
We also use [RobotPy](https://robotpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Here are some more guides for using RobotPy specifically.

- [Anatomy of a Robot](https://robotpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide/anatomy.html)
- [MagicBot Framework](https://robotpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/frameworks/magicbot.html)

## Git
Our code is versioned using [Git](https://git-scm.com/). Git lets us collaborate on code and keep track of changes.
